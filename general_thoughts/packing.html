		<h1>Packing</h1>
		<h2>What kind of Pack</h2>
		<p>
		I'm a huge believer in hip-belts.  When you're wearing your pack, you want most, if
		not all, of the weight being supported by your hips, <i>not</i> your shoulders.
		Any amount of weight on your shoulders will become very noticable and even sore
		after many miles of hiking with a reasonably heavy pack.  Don't get a pack with
		a flimsy or thin hip-belt.  The hip-belt should be big and beafy and meant for
		serious business.
		</p>
		<p>
		My favorite kind of pack is an internal frame pack with a lid that top-loads, like a ruck sack,
		but also has good side-zip access.
		(Admittedly, I haven't try any other kinds of packs, but I know this works really
		well.)  A frame keeps the pack stable (which you really need if skis are mounted on it),
		and gives the pack some rigidity so that the hip-belt can do its job better.
		</p>
		<p>
		A good pack (or any piece of good gear really) fallows a minimalistic approach
		and principle of general applicability rather than trying to specialize too much.
		A pack with a million features is probably not good.  Simpler is better and more
		reliable.  Make sure there's a way to securely attach ice tools <i>externally</i>,
		and that you can fit a shover <i>internally</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
		A good pack will also keep a low profile so that when you're bush-whacking, your pack
		isn't getting snagged on trees and bushes.  Again, this is why it's important that
		your shovel be stored internally.  You also don't want to lose your shovel!
		</p>
		<p>
		Now what about storage capacity?  I think 50 liters is pretty good for day tours.
		I can't speak to winter camping here, because, admittedly, I've never done it (except
		with the scouts many years ago), but I've done a lot of big ~12-hours days.
		</p>
		<p>
		Speaking of capacity, this also brings up the question of air-bags.  I've never owned one,
		and I'm not saying I wouldn't want the extra margin of luck that an airbag brings you,
		but I am saying that, to me, it seem to not be worth the expense in terms of volume displacement
		in your pack.  I'm surprised people with air-bags can fit everything else they need in those
		tiny packs where the air-bag seems to take up most of the space.
		</p>
		<h2>What to Pack</h2>
		<p>
		The more you tour, the more you'll get a feel for what you really needed to bring,
		and what you didn't.  Over time, you can get more efficient about what you bring.
		Of course, just because you didn't use something (e.g., a head-lamp), doesn't mean
		it's not somthing you should always bring.  I <i>always</i> bring a head-lamp
		with extra batteries, and a back-up light I can use to load those batteries, or
		to just use on its own.  I have been benighted several times, quite far from my
		car.  On a few occations, I had no head-lamp.  On one of these, it was a long,
		spooky walk through the deep dark woods.  On another, I had plenty of moon-light.
		In any case, bring a head-lamp, just in case.
		</p>
		<p>
		Food, water and layers are the most imporant and fundamental packing items.
		How much of each?  Again, it take experience to know and depends on the tour.
		You have to tune as you tour more and more.  (And if you do bring food and
		water, don't forget to use it on a regular basis!  Keep your energy levels
		up continuously, but also ration if necessary to stretch it out.  Note that
		if you had to ration, you didn't bring enough.)
		</p>
		<p>
		And then there is, of course, the beacon, shovel and probe (and snow saw too.)
		It's contraversial, but again, I'll mention here that I sometimes don't take
		these in order to save weight, but generally, you should always have them with
		you.  Note that even if you and your touring partner have these, they do you
		know good if you don't know how to use them, and haven't practiced with them.
		Admittedly, I can't remember the last time I practiced a beacon search.
		I'm not proud of that, by the way.
		</p>
		<p>
		Your beacon should be worn on your person at all times and not be in your pack at all.
		It should be worn just over your first layer--a layer you will never remove during
		the tour (unless you're into nude first descents, or that sort of thing.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Gloves are really important.  I always take at least two pairs of insulating gloves,
		and a couple pair of liner gloves.  As the tour goes on, if one pair gets wet,
		you can switch to a dry pair.  I usually stave off the switch until I really
		have to do it in order to stretch out my supply of gloves.
		</p>
		<p>
		I've always been terrible about bringing first-aide stuff in that I just never do it,
		but it's probably good to make sure you've got something like that in there.
		Heli-straps can be used as ternicuts!
		</p>
		<!--tools for bindings
		crampons (boot and skis)
		leashes (i lost a ski once, embarrassed to say)
		ice-axe, but leave home to save weight if you know you won't need it.
		helistraps!!
		don't bring skin savers.  dumb.  was up skins and toss them in pack during transition-->
		<h2>How to Pack</h2>
		<img src="images/skis_on_pack.jpg" align="right"/>
		<p>
		One often overlooked thing about packing for BC skiing (or really any kind
		of long hike) is the weight distribution of your pack.  When you're wearing
		your pack, you want it to change your center of mass as little as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
		I always like to empty my pack the night before a tour (or morning of) and
		repack it from scratch, because I never want to bring anything I don't really
		need, especially for weight reasons.  Also, this way, you never forget what's
		in your pack.  For every tour, you know exactly what you're carrying, and where.
		</p>
		<p>
		That also brings up the point that it's easy to get things jumbled in your
		pack during a tour.  It's hard to stay organized.  It just takes some practice.
