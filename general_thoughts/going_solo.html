		<h1>Going Solo</h1>
		<p>
		My first thought on going solo is this: don't do it.  That's right.  Just don't do it.
		Doing so breaks one of the cardinal rules of backcountry skiing, and it's not hard to
		see why it's such an important rule.  Clearly, if you get burried in an avalanche and
		you're alone, then there's no one around who can dig you out!  But it doesn't have to
		be an avalanche.  All sorts of things can go wrong in the backcountry, miles from your car.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now, all that being said, why is it that I tour almost exclusively alone?  Admittedly,
		I can't avoid hypacritasism here, but I can tell you why I solo tour, and it's very simple.
		If I did not go solo, then (pause for dramatic effect) then I would just never go!  And that's
		just not acceptable to me.
		</p>
		<p>
		You see, there are some in this world blessed with popularity and skill, and you
		need both to tour in a group.  If you're not popular, then you'll have no friends to begin with.
		If you're not skilled, then you won't keep any friends, because they won't want to
		tour with you after having given you a chance, but you put on a shit-show for them.
		</p>
		<p>
		The beauty of the solo tour is that you can go at your own pace, you're not influenced
		by anyone else's decisions, there's no social pressure or anxiety, and you get ultimate
		peace and solitude in the mountains.  Further, you're not limited by someone showing up
		late to the trail-head and then saying, "hey, just so you know, I need to be back at 2:00 p.m."
		Great, now our day is shot.
		</p>
		<p>
		You and your skiing partner have to be evenly matched in almost every aspect: physical fitness,
		skill, goals, dedication, etc.  If you have such a partner, consider yourself very lucky!
		</p>
		<p>
		Dare I say, there are tours where I do not take with me a beacon, shovel or a probe?
		Blasphame, you say?!  Always taking a beacon with you is good practice, even if you're
		out solo, because it re-enforces the habit, and can mean the difference between your
		family getting your body back immediately or having to wait until Spring.  I will sometimes
		take a shovel and probe in case I want to perform some snowpit analysis.  When breaking
		trail, or poking the snow doesn't give you any obvious signs of instability, but you know
		there may be some PWLs lerking in the snowpack, it's time to dig.  One of my avalanche instructors,
		Tyson Bradley, once said, "Hey, if you don't want to know what's going on in the snowpack, then
		by all means, don't dig.  Ignorance is bliss."
		</p>
		<p>
		But in truth, there have been many spring tours where I left the beacon, shovel and probe
		at home to save weight.  When you're doing a really big one-and-doner tour, every ounce counts.
		</p>
		<p>
		All in all, I really love getting up into the mountains by myself, but I don't take it lightly.
		If you're going to do it, you can't afford to make a mistake.  Avalanche risk management is
		not a calculus.  It's all about bets.  Not only do you have to be able to make good bets, but
		you also have be able to base those bets on accurate observations, and recognize which observations
		are significant, and which aren't.  Admittely, I'm more dependant on the UAC forcast than anyting
		else.  I try to make my own field observation, and have turned back a few times after getting
		full propagation in an ECT, but it's too hard to get up into the mountains often enough to get
		as big a picture as you can get with the aid of the UAC and those that contribute observations
		to their website.
		</p>
		<p>In any case, you should always be trying to formulate your own opinion about
		the current state of the snowpack, and then be correlating that with the UAC, and always be
		willing to change your mind and update your thinking while in the field.  If you're never turning
		back from a ski-touring goal, then you're probably doing something wrong.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'll add here that I know there are a lot of people who partice the black-art of the solo tour,
		and I even know a few of them personally.  They've done it for years successfully, so they're both
		good and lucky, more good than lucky, I presume.  Now, I'm not trying to use them as an excuse, but I'll
		just say that I can see why they do it.  One person almost always moves faster than a group,
		and we all value our solitude and freedom, not to mention having an untracked slope all to ourselves.
		</p>
		<p>
		It's contraversial, but I'm not going to stop solo touring.  I might run across some touring
		groups in Mill-D, for example, and they might look down on me for being out by myself, but
		I don't care what they think.  I don't think they have all the information to judge correctly.
		I also don't buy the argument that I'm putting them at risk.  I am part of the risk they must
		be willing to assume if they're going to go into the mountains, and that goes both ways.
		(I'm taking a risk being near them too.)
		</p>
		<p>
		One down-side of solo-touring that I've read about is that you miss-out on the "wisdom of
		the crowd" benefit; the idea being that multiple heads are better than one.  On the other hand,
		I think that crowds can be dumber than an individual who isn't going to feel any social
		pressure.  Going it alone, you're not afraid you're going to ruin anyone's day by aborting
		the mission.  You're also not going to be decieved by the self-proclaimed expert of the
		group.  (You might just decieve your self, though, I suppose.)  But I don't dismiss the idea
		that with more people, you should have more brain-compute power for potentially
		making good observations and decisions.
