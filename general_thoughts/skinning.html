		<h1>Skinning</h1>
		<p>
		Skinning is a skill in and of itself alongside skiing.  Until you develop
		good skinning skills, backcountry travel can be a bit frustrating.
		</p>
		<h2>Just Walking</h2>
		<p>
		Not just walking!  Has your mom ever told you not to drag your feet?
		Well, this is the one time we don't listen to that sage advice.
		When skinning (not walking) you want to drag your feet.  This is more efficient,
		because you want the ground to bear the weight of the skis, not your legs or feet.
		Plus, dragging the skins across the snow will promote the proper grain direction on the skin.
		(I always get frustrated when I slide backwards on my skins, and it's because I'm too fat.)
		</p>
		<p>
		When going up-hill, you have to resist the urge to lean forward.  Keep your weight back
		as much as possible to maintain your grip.
		</p>
		<h2>Switch Backs</h2>
		<p>
		Generally, you want to make long switch-backs when you can.  (The major acception here
		is that your first priority is to make sure you're making smart terrain choices to
		avoid avalanche terrain if at all possible.)  Going straight up the fall-line is not
		efficient (though many freakishly strong/light-weight skinners of Wasangelous do this and making a
		ridiculous BS skin track that almost no one can follow!)  So you make switch-backs
		to ease the grade of the ascent.
		</p>
		<h2>Switch Back Turns</h2>
		<p>
		There are, as far as I know, 3 basic kinds of turns you can do at the end of a switch-back.
		They are, in order of most efficient to less, the AVA turn, a 90 degree turn, and a 180 degree turn.
		My take is that you should always do the most efficient turn you can reasonably get away
		with.  The best of these turns, I've found, however, for steep technical skinning is the 180-degree turn,
		which I'll talk about in a moment.
		</p>
		<h3>The AVA Turn</h3>
		<p>
		This is really simple.  You just make an A with your skis, then a V, then an A, and so on.
		You start with A first by moving the outside ski, but when you get good at it, it doesn't
		really matter, because you'll be good enough at preventing yourself from stepping on your
		own tips and tails.  Again, this is the most efficient turn, and I always try to do this
		type of turn instead of a kick turn (90 or 180), because kick turns, over time, eat up a
		lot of energy.
		</p>
		<h3>The 90-degree Kick Turn</h3>
		<p>
		It helps to do about a million of these so that you can do one without getting tripped up
		and falling over.
		</p>
		<p>
		At the end of a switch-back, start with the first move of an AVA turn (a single A move), moving
		the ouside ski slightly up the slope.  Now swing the tail of the inside ski over the tail of
		the outside ski, then slide it forward until the inside ski's tail clear that of the outside ski.
		Replant the poles, then commit to a wait transfer as you lift the outside ski to bring it over.
		As you do, sometimes a subtle heal flick with the outside foot is helpful to get the outside ski's
		tip to clear the slope as your bring it over to match the inside ski.  This flick is just where
		your heal whacks the binding to pop the ski-tip up.  Sometimes it's necessary, sometimes not.
		</p>
		<h3>The 180-degree Kick Turn</h3>
		<p>
		At the end of a switch-back, start with a very small AVA turn to get yourself
		perpendicular to the fall-line, then replant your poles in preparation for the
		next step.  We now do the opposite of a down-hill kick-turn.
		Instead of swinging the down-hill ski over 180, we'll do that with the up-hill ski.
		Once the feet are matched, commit to the weight transfer and swing the down-hill ski
		over to match, doing a heal-flick to get the ski tip to clear the slope.
		You're now facing the opposite direction, and still perpendicular to the fall-line.
		</p>
		<p>
		Note that in any kick-turn, it sometimes helps to go a little further than those
		who left the skin track you were following, if any.  (But of course, real BC skiers are breaking
		trail 100% of the time!)
