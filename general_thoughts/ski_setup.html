		<h1>Ski Setup</h1>
		<p>
		Like many backcountry skiers, I went through an evolution of equipment, not just as new
		equipment became available, but as I learned what worked better and what didn't.
		I'll start with the skis.
		</p>
		<h2>Skis</h2>
		<p>
		My first pair of skis were K2 Apache Outlaws with a frame binding.  Both the skis and
		the bindings were super heavy.  Frame bindings are very safe in that they have release
		characteristics as good as any dedicated in-bounds down-hill-only binding would have,
		but you have to left the frame with each step which, over thousands of steps, adds up
		to a lot of energy wasted.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I had the money, I thought I could do better, but was still under the false notion that
		I could buy a pair of skis that would work for both in-bounds and out-of-bounds skiing--the
		so-called "one ski quiver", as they say.  This time I bought some Black Crows Atris skis and
		mounted a Shift binding on them.  Much lighter than the K2 skis, these were (and continue to
		be) my dedicated resort ski, and are so much fun!  They're still heavy enough that they have
		the momentum you need to feel really stable at higher speeds, but they're still very surfy.
		</p>
		<p>
		I did some big tours with the Crows, but found that they still just weren't practical enough
		for that purpose.  (There really is no such thing as a one ski quiver.)  They were still just
		too heavy.  The Shift binding was also still way too heavy, thought it too, like frame bindings,
		are as safe as dedicated down-hill alpine bindings.  What makes them supposedly better for touring
		is that while they about as great as an in-bounds binding, they tour like a pin binding.  So your
		heal is free to left by itself.  Still, I found that the mechanisms of the binding were so easily
		gunked up with snow that I had to manually clear them with every transition.
		Generally, the more complicated anything is, the more that can go wrong with it.
		</p>
		<p>
		Thinking I knew the right way to go at this point, my next pair of skis were the BD Helio 88s
		with a Ski Trab Titan Vario binding.  These are super ultra-lightweight!  And the bindings really
		do work.  I never charge hard in the backcountry (because I don't want to hurt myself miles
		from my car), so I never had any pre-release problems, yet I know the binding will let me out
		when I need it (because I've crashed and popped out of both of them before), though it does take
		a bit more torque on your legs.  For big, all-day, one-and-doner missions, these are often my
		go-to skis, and they really let you fly up the mountain.  But you have to understand what these
		skis are designed for in order to understand that they really are great skis.  Many hate them,
		but only because they don't get their speciality.  You see, being so light-weight, the skis are
		more easily subject to deflection in variable or many other less-than-ideal snow conditions.
		They just take more patience and practice, and I'd say balance and strength too.
		</p>
		<p>
		Lastly, I found a great middle-ground and my best all-around backcountry skis--the Elan Ripstick
		Tours.  (Again, I slapped a Titan Vario binding on their, because I knew it worked and I didn't want
		to risk mounting a binding that I wouldn't like as much.)  These are my favorite skis!  They're
		still lightweight enough so that you don't feel, at the end of the day, like you have boat anchors
		on your feet, yet they are still heavy enough to be more stable at speed.  And they're super surfy!
		They have some kind of special shape to help with turning, which, heaven knows, I need, because my
		ski technique is terrible.
		</p>
		<h2>Boots</h2>
		<p>
		Most people hate ski boots and there's good reason for that.  In fact, many people probably
		just don't ski because of the boot situation, which is sad.  You just have to find the right
		boots, and be willing to break them in and get used to them.  I have gone through some serious
		pain with ski boots, but I haven't let that stop me from the sport of skiing.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'll just talk here about my two favorite pair of backcountry ski boots.  The first are
		my Atom Backlands.  These boots are amazing!  The flex is very soft, and you can drive
		a car with them (which I always do and it's so convenient.)  These boots are super lightweight
		and crampon compatable.  (I have often used them with crampons for serious missions.)
		Many people will think this boot is two soft, but I would disagree.  Again, it's all about
		practice and balance, and understanding what the boot is designed to do.  It's not a general
		purpose ski boot.  It's designed to let you fly up the mountain and then get down it reasonably,
		or in really good style if conditions are right.
		</p>
		<p>
		With all my boots I've had to punch them, and the Backlands are no exception.  I have major
		tayler's bunion on my feet, and so I've had to punch Backland shells to accomodate my feet.
		</p>
		<p>
		My other favorite pair (I can have more than one!) are my Dynafit Radicals Pros.  These, at the
		start, hurt my feet worse than any other ski boot!  I epiced in them on my first major tour with
		them and didn't think I'd make it home, because my feet hurt so bad.  Pulling them off at the
		end of that day, I have to admit taking a few minutes to just cry out the pain.
		</p>
		<p>
		I used to be against heat-molding liners.  That is, until I did that with the Redical Pros, and
		it solved my bunion problem without punching the shell.  The shell still needed to be punched,
		though, to fix the arch area.  (I'm not sure who in the heck's feet they're designing some of
		these boots for.)
		</p>
		<p>
		The best thing about the Radical Pros is the Hogi Lock mechanism.  It is so convenient to be able
		to do up all your buckles at the truck, and then not touch them at all until you get back.
		It's just one leaver to switch between up-hill and down-hill mode on the boot.  Some don't think
		there's anough articulation, but it's perfectly fine for me.  I think the leaver is a bit difficult
		to throw sometimes, but that's about it.
		</p>
		<p>
		Both these boots ski really well.  The Radical Pros are much stiffer, so they are much
		easier to ski with.  I've been told that you generally need bigger boots to drive bigger skis,
		but I would disagree.  You can drive my Elans with my Backlands just fine, though I've remounted
		the bindings since so that only the Radical Pros will work with the Elans.  Both boots work great
		with those skis.
