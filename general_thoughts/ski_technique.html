		<h1>Ski Technique</h1>
		<p>
		I'm a terrible skier, so you shouldn't listen to me at all.
		</p>
		<p>
		Still here?  Okay, take what I have to say with a grain of salt.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'll just say here that the break-through I had in ski technique was a realization that
		upper-body position is more important than what you're doing with your legs and feet.
		Why?  Because if your upper-body position is not correct, then it doesn't matter what
		you do with your legs and feet; it just won't work.
		</p>
		<p>
		The basic pattern of skiing is to make a turn into an acceleration zone, finish that turn
		by scrubbing off speed to get yourself back in control, then initiate a new turn.  This is how you
		control your rate of descent.  Getting back in control is key, because if you fail to
		do that, then each new turn will be made less and less in control until you crash.
		</p>
		<h2>Turn Initiation</h2>
		<p>
		This is the hardest part about parallel skiing (aside from keeping your darn skis parallel,
		which I can never seem to do.)  Turn initiation happens at the inflection
		point between turns.  It's the moment where you stop making a left turn and start making
		a right turn, or vice-versa.  One of the keys is realizing that the lower and upper body
		don't make this transition at the same time.  The upper body begins the turn <i>before</i>
		the lower body does.  Why?  Because if you're upper body is not in the right position
		(perpendicular to the slope), then your skis won't turn.  As you're scrubbing off speed,
		your upper body is often parallel to gravity, but you need it to be facing more downhill
		before the skis can turn.
		</p>
		<p>
		But you can't scrubb off too much speed.  You need to also keep enough momentum going so
		that as you let your upper-body fall over your skis and down the hill, your skis not only
		turn at that point, but they're able to drive you through the turn before you fall flat
		on our face.
		</p>
		<p>
		To this day I still occationally find my self "in the back seat" as they say.  When we get
		scared, we sometimes lean away from the steepness, but this is exactly what you don't want
		to do.  You've got to get yourself positioned correctly over your skis at all times.  Again,
		upper body is key.  Before you ask what you're doing wrong with your feet, think about what
		you might be doing wrong with your upper body.
		</p>
		<p>
		I would love to take lessons again if I could.  There are so many techniques I can't do,
		like jump-turning.  That said, there is no substitute for physical fitness.  If you don't
		have the fitness, then you'll never be able to master a technique anyway.
		</p>
		<h2>Survival Skiing</h2>
		<p>
		We've all been in some situations where you just don't fee confident-enough to ski down.
		That's when it's time to just survive.
		</p>
		<p>
		The technique is simple.  You just traverse across the fall-line, losing a bit of altitude
		as you do so, stop, then try to make some sort of zero-speed turn, sometimes a down-hill kick turn,
		but it depends on the precariousness of the terrain.  Sometimes a down-hill kick turn is
		too risky, and a jump turn is a better idea (if you know how to do one!)
		</p>
		<p>
		The down-hill kick turn is a good skill to practice on flat ground first.  You just
		swing the down-hill leg 180 degrees and match your toe with the heal of your up-hill
		foot, then transfer your wait from the up-hill leg to the down-hill one as you commit
		to the turn.  I do these all the time when I just want to face the other way without
		losing any altitude.
