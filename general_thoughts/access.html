		<h1>Access</h2>
		<p>
		One of the biggest challenges to backcountry skiing is access.  The two major
		facits to this are private property and distance (and/or the complexity of the terrain).
		The connection between them
		is usually that to avoid private property, one must take the longer, more circutuatous
		route to your destination.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm a big believer in maintain access.  This is why I'm against the push over the
		decades made by all the ski resorts to expand their boundaries and create link-ups
		between them.  One initiative in particular is to link Alta and Brighton, and Brighton
		with Park City.  It's just a bad idea on so many levels, the most important of which
		is that it absolutely will take away from the backcountry skiing community terrain
		that is currently free to access (if you don't count parking.)  The terrain I'm talking
		about is considered by some to be for novices and beginners, but it is also a jumping-off
		point for more serious terrain for the arrogant elites in the world of backcountry skiing
		or ski mountaineering.  In any case, ski resorts don't need more terrain.  More terrain
		needs to be free, and ski resorts prices are a joke.  Increasingly, skiing in-bounds is
		becoming an activity only for the rich and well-off who can afford to wipe their butts
		with 100 dollar bills.
		</p>
		<p>
		There's a tour I'm thinking of, which will go unnamed, that requires me to skin, very briefly,
		over some private property.  I haven't run into any problems doing so, but it is so unfortunate
		to me that access is technically and lawfully cut off.  Going around it, in this particular case,
		is nearly impossible, and just doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it.  So what do you
		do?  Just stop doing such an incredible tour?  Or maybe just hope for leniency if you ever got
		caught?  I don't know.
		</p>
		<p>
		In some places, like the head of Mueller Park Canyon (Mill Canyon on some maps), there is a
		right-of-way along the GWT or Great Western Trail, but you're not aloud to leave it.
		Needless to say, if you're restricted to a trail, you're not going to be able to do any
		worth-while skiing.
		</p>
		<p>
		Whatever we can do to maintain access and keep the mountains free, in my opinion, is a worthy
		presuit.  The forest service seems to be willing, more and more, to sell its land to private
		developers.  The whole east-site of Francis Peak and Thurstand Peak, for example, has been
		bought up for the development of a private ski resort!  Only the super rich living next to it
		will be able to use it.  It's one thing to make a ski resort, but another to make it so
		exclusive, especially in a day when ski resorts are so over-crowded.  It's just wrong.
		</p>
		<p>
		Acces is a big issue.  I'm not going to take any of the free terrain I enjoy today for granted.
		One day, who knows.  It may be bought up and developed, or all ways of getting to that terrain
		may get blocked by private property.  Just enjoy it all while we can, I suppose.
