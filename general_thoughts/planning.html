		<h1>Planning</h1>
		<p>
		Every tour begins with a good plan at home.  (Fail to plan, plan to fail!)
		Admittedly, I do a lot of spur-of-the-moment tours, and as you might imagine,
		they don't always work out, because I didn't think things through well-enough.
		</p>
		<!-- Hike to bike to ski tours, swapping out footwear and socks-->
		<!-- avalanche planning, check UAC, sometimes report not ready as early as you need
		to start, so you need to have been look at all UAC forcasts since start of season
		in order to be able to extrapolate for the day at the very least.-->
