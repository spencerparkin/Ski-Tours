		<p>
		Some days in the backcountry are amazing; others, not so much, but I'm always thankful
		to get out.  There is something about the alpine environment that I just don't know how
		to describe.  Being there, with the snow-covered slopes, the ever-greens, rocky peaks,
		quaking aspens, just taking it all in, there is a sense of contentment (if you can ignore
		all your sins for a moment), that is very real.  I consider it a gift.  There are many
		from Heavenly Father, but this one is particularly inspiring to me, because not everyone
		sees it, appreciates it, or even knows it's there.  Sure, you can spy the mountains from
		down below, but there just isn't any substitute for being there.
