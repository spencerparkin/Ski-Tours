	<h1>Ethics</h2>
	<p>
	Being a solo tourer, I tend to throw some ethics to the wind, because I feel
	a bit rejected by the ski touring commity, so I just don't give a damn.  In fact,
	I may break the ethics just out of spite.  That said, there are still some things
	that are really important.
	</p>
	<p>
	First, be aware of other parties.  You don't want to ski above them and potentially
	trigger an avalanche on top of them.  Of course, you wouldn't want to live with that either.
	Fortunately, I try to go where no one else can be found, so this usually isn't a problem.
	</p>
	<p>
	Second, don't poach.  This is where you cut your ascent short so that you can get fresh
	tracks that you wouldn't get if you went to the top, because another party is ahead of
	you.  That's just lame.  Again, not really a problem for me most of the time, because I
	try to avoid other people when I can.
	</p>
	<p>
	Lastly, spoon your turns.  This is all about making efficient use of untracked terrain.
	You should try to do this when you can so that others can have some untracked powder too.
	Not just that, but you want to maximize powder for yourself as well, so it just makes sense.
	</p>
	<p>
	That said, there are a few ethics rules I've heard of where I don't entirely agree.
	The first is to leave untracked terrain for others.  I know I said to spoon your turns,
	and I generally agree, but when all is said and done, <i>you</i> did the work of getting up the
	mountain before anyone else; and I say, if that's the case, then you can darn well ski
	whatever the hell you want, spooned or not, and I wouldn't blame anyone for doing so.
	A great thing about skiing out-of-bounds is not having any ski patrol around to yell
	at you and say you can't ski there or what have you.  Screw the ski-patrol!  This is the
	backcountry!  (Of course, you won't be saying that if some of those same people are helping
	to load you onto a stretcher to get you heli'd off the mountain, deep in the backcountry.)
	</p>
	<p>
	Another ethics rule is to never solo-tour as it makes you a liability for other parties.
	Sorry, but there are many risks inherent to mountain travel, and if you can't accept me
	as one of them, then stay home!  I have as much right to be here as you do, popular or not.
	</p>
	<p>
	Another rule I can recall is that large groups shouldn't come into an area and track it all
	out in a single day.  I just hate it when that happens, and my heart just sinks after hours of
	walking and skinning on approach, only to finally get my first view of the mountain and find that it's been
	all tracked out.  That said, I have to be consistent here.  If they did the work and got
	there first, then I say, that's just the name of the game.  The mountain will always be there.
	There will be another storm.  There will be another season.  Better luck next time.
	</p>
	<p>
	Lastly, there's whooping and hollering.  I'm guilty of it, but I've changed my ways.  Don't do it.
	Keep the mountain solace as much as you can.  Reserve yelling for when it's important,
	such as in the case of letting people know where you are in a rescue situation.
	</p>
	<p>
	Along those same lines, I absolutely despize snowmobiles and motorized ski-bikes.  I hate encountering them.
	They stink to high hell and they're loud, they track everything out in minutes, and the riders don't
	give a damn if you're there trying to ski-tour.  All that said, I acknolwedge their right to be there
	to recreate, and I'll even defend that right.  That doesn't mean I have to like it, though.
	Unfortunately, this kind of motorized recreation in the backcountry has become extremely ubiquitous
	in recent years.  There aren't many places you can find anymore that snowmobiles can't get access to and
	then ravage to high hell.  Count yourself lucky if you can avoid them.
