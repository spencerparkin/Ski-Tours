		<h1>Places I've Toured</h1>
		<p>
		This is a compilation of many (not all, but many) places I've toured in the Wasatch and what my experience was on those tours.
		I detail what it was like for me, the mistakes I made, how I got up, how I got down, etc.
		I don't have pictures for every tour, but I have some things to say about them, for whatever it's worth.
		Note that I don't claim any originality on methods of access.  In some cases my approach
		was taken from the experiences of others.  I will try to cite those sources wherever I can.

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
		Here I'll blab on a bit about the tourer in these notes (me).  I did not grow up skiing.
		In many ways, I believe that put me at a great disadvantage compared to those who did--those
		who can consider skiing a native language.  I learned to ski in my mid-twenties, but even then
		didn't take it too seriously.  At some point, however, I caught the bug, and then skiing at
		Brighton was the only thing I could think about.  I did this as much as I could while at the
		same time trying to break into backcountry skiing.
		</p>
		<p>
		Learning to backcountry ski is very difficult, and it's not for everyone.  My initial touring
		season was very frustrating, and it took quite a bit of time to get to a point where I felt
		like I was moving efficiently in the mountains and not always getting tripped up or falling
		over.  Those difficulties, combined with the cold and harsh conditions, not to mention the terrifying
		prospect of the white death (avalanches), are natural barriers
		to entry, and it's a good thing too or else the mountains beyond the ski resorts would just be
		way too crowded.  One of the greatest things about backcountry skiing is getting away from those crowds.
		</p>
		<p>
		The crowds withstanding, there is no substitute for lift-assisted
		skiing.  You will not become a better skier in the backcountry, because there you'll be
		spending most of your time skinning or walking.  The backcountry, rather, is the place where
		you'll be putting your skiing skills to the test.  All that said, what I've found is that the
		backcountry is the <i>only</i> place where I could go to learn to ski powder, because such snow
		conditions are almost unheard of inbounds.  It just gets tracked out too quickly.  So, as you
		can imagine, I suck at powder skiing, but I'd like to believe I've got a bit better at it over
		the years.
		</p>
		<p>
		I think what drew me to backcountry skiing was, once I had caught the skiing bug, a realization that
		it was a combination of two things I really liked: hiking and skiing.  Furthermore, years before
		I ever tried to skin into the mountains, I was an avid snowshoer.  A very lame activity by comparison
		to the glamer of backcountry skiing, to this day, I still see its merits, and have an appreciation for
		it as another way to get up into the beautiful alpine environment.  And, dare I say, after all my years
		of backcountry skiing, I still think that snowshoes make more sense than skis in some situations.
		Now, 99% of the time, I would rather be on skis, and skis make more sense, but don't throw your
		snowshoes away.
		</p>
		<p>
		I recall reading in a book that the art of backcountry skiing is all about being in the right place
		at the right time.  I can confirm this bit of wisdom.  Perhaps more accurately, it's all about not
		being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  You see, the way I approach any tour is with almost zero
		expectations.  Specifically, the <i>only</i> expectation I have is getting back to the truck.
		This way, if the snow is good or the skiing is good, it's always a bonus.  But my point is that
		if you are not willing to get up into the mountains and fail (fail, not die, mind you), and fail
		a lot, then you'll miss those rare opportunities to be in the right place at the right time.
		</p>
		<p>
		Case and point: Kenny Peak is one of my favorite backcountry ski destinations, because hardly anyone
		skis there.  And why?  Because it's not a favorable aspect!  Furthermore, it's not just destroyed by
		the sun, but it's also often hammered by the wind.  So why the hell do I go there?  Because I've learned
		by experience that if you catch it at just the right time, it's a really fun slope to ski.  My very best
		powder day ever was on Kenny Peak.  I had tried and failed to skin up there after a significant dump.
		Two days later, I tried again, and the track I had put in two days prior made it practical to get up
		there.  (Breaking trail is hard.)  In those two days, by some miracle, no wind or sun damaged the slope.
		When I got to Kenny Peak, it was cold smoke powder!  I couldn't believe how well it skied, even being
		a lousy skier.
		</p>
		<p>
		Maybe I've been a bit to obsessed with backcountry skiing.  It's hard not to be if you're one of those
		who has discovered the secret.  It's interesting to me how many balk at the idea of going into the
		mountains in winter.  They simply have no idea what they're missing.  They don't know the secret!
		Here's the secret: through all the trial and tribulation, the hardship and the cold, the frustration
		and the failures, the rewards of going into the mountains for turns or even just sightseeing far
		outweighs any of those things.
		One can't help but seeing a life-lesson in all this.  If we can just get through this
		mortality, this veil of tears, and be faithful to the end, I believe the Lord will make
		it worth our while.
