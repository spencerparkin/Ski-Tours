		<h1>Ford Canyon</h1>
		<p>
		I had stared out my dinning room window countless times up at Ford Canyon near
		Bountiful Peak, wondering if the skiing was any good up there.  And one of the beauties
		of backcountry skiing, of course, is that you can get yourself up there and answer the question,
		and one day that's just what I did, and it was awesome.
		</p>
		<p>
		The approach is pretty darn tough.  The Davis Creek Trail is an option, but that will
		add quite a few miles to your approach and exit.  I took the shortest route I could
		find, straight up the ridge in question from the Fire Brake road, no trail, until I
		connected with a section of the Bountiful Peak Trail (part of the Davis Creek Trail system.)
		It wasn't too long afterword that I could start skinning, and the approach was really fun,
		and really beautiful, and there was a ton of easy, mellow skiing down the main ridge at
		the end of the day.
		</p>

		Once I reached the head of Ford Canyon, I could start skiing into it.  I stuck to the
		south facing slopes, which were softened by the spring sun enough to be fun.  They all
		land in a terrain trap, so be aware of that.
		</p>
		<p>
		I remember doing several laps while I was there, and having major bathroom issues.  TMI?
		Sorry.  It was still a great day, and I've been meaning to go back ever since.
