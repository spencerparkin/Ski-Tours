		<h1>Mud/Rice Devide</h1>
		<img src="images/rice_bowl.jpg" align="right"/>
		<p>
		There is a great north-east aspect in Farmington Canyon just below Mud Peak,
		and two bowls (Mud Bowl and Rice Bowl) below it, separated by a devide, and
		it's just an absolutely fantastic backcountry ski destination.  Unfortunately,
		getting there is not easy.  Along time ago, before my time as a ski tourer,
		the Farmington Canyon road was plowed for the workers who needed to get up
		to the radar towers on Francis Peak.  When a year came that the road washed out,
		the workers were choppered to the peak until the road could be repared.  Once
		it was repaired, it was decided that the chopper was cheaper than keeping the
		canyon road plowed, and thus, access to the Mud/Rice devide became much harder.
		(I learned this story from Owen Reeder, a veteran backcountry skiier of the Wasatch Range.)
		</p>
		<p>
		There are 3 ways I've done this tour.  They are as follows.
		</p>
		<h2>Approach #1</h2>
		<p>
		One way to get up there is along the Farmington Spine.  (I have to give credit for
		this idea to someone's blog, I forget exactly who.) This is the southern ridge
		of Farmington Canyon, which leads directly up to Mud Peak.  It's steep and hard on the
		knees for the return trip, but it's not an entirely unpractical approach.  I've done it
		many times.
		</p>
		<p>
		It begins with a booter for a long way (I'm terrible at giving distance or elevation
		gains, so I won't bother) until you reach a relatively flatter point on the ridge where
		you can begin skinning, which is still well before you are above tree-line.  The skinning
		isn't too wacky, and eventually spits you out on an open slope, which is pretty fun to
		ski on the return.  It's a straightforward and beautiful skin from here to Mud Peak.
		</p>
		<p>
		Note that on the return, you can ski much of the spin back down, and this by itself makes
		this approach worthwhile, in my opinion.  One particular section is a bit flat, so you want
		to make sure your skis are waxed, and then come at with as much speed as you can muster.
		Standing on your skis with all those trees whizzing by is really fun.
		</p>
		<p>
		Once you reach the fun slope of the spine, ski the double fall-line until you reach the tree line.
		At this point, though it's a bush-whack ski, it's worth keeping the skis on, for the sake of
		boyancy, for as long as you can, preferably until you can get right back to the skin-up point.
		It's there that you'll transition
		back to boots and then try to baby your knees for the long trudge back down the steep trail to your
		car.
		</p>
		<p>
		This way of reaching Mud Peak is tough, but beautiful.  Also note that it means you're committed
		to making one last ascent of Mud Peak from the other side before going home, unless you plan to
		hitch-hike down Farmington Canyon.  Good luck with that.
		</p>
		<p>
		It's also worth noting that although you'll skin quite a ways to mud peak along the spine, this
		won't give you any significant stability information for Mud and Rice bowls, because nothing
		you've skinned up is anywhere near representative of the aspect you're going to ski.
		</p>
		<h2>Approach #2</h2>
		<p>
		For Spring skiing, it works well to bring a bike.  If you have an E-bike, you're spoiled, and
		you can just bike to the Sherrif's cabin along the canyon road and back at the end of the tour.
		For the rest of us (myself included), I found that it's not too bad to push your bike up the
		Farmington Canyon trail to Sunset Campground (now permantly closed), and then from there, bike
		to the cabin.  (Biking up the Farmington Canyon road should only be attempted by those who are
		extremely fit.)  When the tour is o'er, just coast back down the canyon road on your bike, hoping
		your brakes don't burn up or fail, and that you don't coast of the edge of a cliff.  In this way,
		you could call this method a hike-to-bike-to-ski tour!
		</p>
		<h2>Approach #3</h2>
		<p>
		The simplest of the 3, and the only one that works (for me) mid-winter (since I don't have a snowmobile,
		or access to the locked gate at the mounth of the canyon, or friggin' helicopter), is to just walk to
		the Sherrif's cabin using
		the Farmington Canyon trail as a short-cut.  Its works fine, but the return is quite arduous at the
		end of the day.  Note that you can ski down the road from the cabin for quite a ways, but you won't be
		able to reach Sunset Campground without a transition back to skins, unless you're a very strong skater.
		When I did all this, I was lucky enough to not encounter any vehicles or snowmachines on the canyon road,
		but I know that's not typical.
		</p>
		<h2>The Tour</h2>
		<img src="images/mud_peak.jpg" align="right"/>
		<p>
		The approaches mentioned aside, the tour really just starts at the Sherrif's cabin.  From here,
		you have to make a stream crossing which ranges, year-round, from easy to very difficult.  In the
		raging spring, I've almost gotten taken away by the strong current and surely drowned.  Mid-winter,
		snow-bridges are quite reliable.  In any case, know that there is a fjorde up-stream of the cabin
		that you might consider as an alternative.  (I learned this from a guy named Brett Fuller, a friend
		of Owen Reeder, who frequents this tour so much, I always wonder if he's skied it out before I ever
		get there.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Once passed the stream, skin by the beaver dams, admiring their work, and then up the slope to the
		devide.  High up on the devide, just before it blends into the wonderful slopes above, take note of
		the fun skiing through an aspen forest on your right.  You'll find a ton of options and subtly different
		aspects, all roughly north-eastern, on the slopes below Mud Peak.  Looking up at it (or down from the top),
		you just can't help but feel over-joyed at how fun it's going to be!  (I've been there when the skiing
		was slide-for-life icy death cookie, or fantastic powder.)  In any case, the suble changes in aspect
		give more variety to the place as in the Wasatch, aspect plays a huge role in snow-quality.
		</p>
		<p>
		The skiing is just so good from the top of Mud Peak.  I rarely ski into Mud bowl, and do must of my
		skiing into Rice.  From the top, it's a wide open field of bliss and joy, and then it gets even funner
		as it descends into the evergreens where there are many little shots to discover and explore.
		</p>
		<p>
		Beware of the terrain traps when trying to get back to the cabin (if you didn't approach from the spine.)
		I've seen Brett ski the north side of Rice Bowl to avoid such a trap, which is a good option if
		conditions permit.
