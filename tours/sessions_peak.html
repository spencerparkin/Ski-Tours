		<h1>Session's Peak</h1>
		<p>
		The highest peak on Session's Ridge is one that I've named Session's Peak, and
		it sits above Rocky Basin, a side-drainage of Mueller Park canyon, with a very
		obvious ski line below it, dropping into the basin.  You can see it from many
		places, including the freeway, and it called to me for a very long time saying,
		"ski me!"  Since then I've skied it many times, and it's one of my favorite
		backcountry skiing objectives.
		</p>
		<p>
		There's nothing like seeing a line that inspires you for its beauty and prominence,
		and then making it a reality.  That's one of the great things about backcountry skiing.
		Yes, you have to walk to the top, but it so much more fulfilling that way.  At least,
		that's how I feel about it.  I know many people don't give a hoot about earning their
		turns, and that's perfectly fine.  For me, though, looking back at a majestic peak
		with my single solitary ski track running down it, is a great feeling that I wouldn't
		trade for anything.  Was I the first to ever ski it?  Probably not, but I don't care.
		I'm the only one who skied it today.
		</p>
		<h2>The Approach</h2>
		<p>
		Session's Peak is easily seen from the freeway, but it's not easy to get to, or return
		from.  I've approached two different ways, both requiring that you first gain Kenny Peak.
		One there, you can follow the ridge all the way to Session's Peak, or you can descent from
		Kenny Peak into the gut of Rocky Basin, then ascend the ski descent goal to the top of
		Session's Peak.  There are some of obvious trade-offs between these two options.
		</p>
		<p>
		The first trade-off is obviously one of elevation gain/loss.  Descending into the basin
		only to have to regain a bunch of elevation is a bit annoying, but you are getting an
		additional ski run in the process.  The other trade-off is that the ridge can be pretty
		difficult and time-consuming.  Ice-axe and crampons are recommended.  Watch out for
		cornices and snow bridges!  There is one spot where a down-climb is needed, and it's
		always the trickiest part of the ridge.
		</p>
		<p>
		One time I decided to descend into the basin from Kenny Peak.  Now, prior to that, the
		day started out as a typically cold winter day, but became unusually warm.  Not only that,
		but it became unusually warm, unusually <i>fast</i>!  Furthermore, this was the first time
		the snowpack at ever been stressed in this manner.  These non-visual changes by themselves
		should have been a huge red flag.  As I descended, there were pin-wheels, which were another
		red flag, but I kept going.
		</p>
		<p>
		Note that Rocky Basin is called that for a reason.  There are lots of rocks, and the sun
		heats them up and they, in turn, heat the snow.  As I descended a slope walled by pretty rock
		formations, little did I know that I had triggered a wet slide, and it was chasing me down.
		(It would be a good idea to look back up the slope occationally to see if anything is chasing you.)
		Well, I got super lucky, because, for whatever reason, I decided to traverse a bit and ski
		a different fall-line.  I made a few turns, then decided to traverse over and ski the original
		fall-line.  Before I could do that, though, a rush of wet-sliding snow went wizzing by in front
		of me.  I stopped immediately and watched all the snow go by.
		</p>
		<p>
		This avalanche didn't have to bury me to be dangerous, or even injur me, although it could certainly
		have done either one.  It could have just taken my skis away.  If you lose your skis or have
		a major equipment failure out in the field, it can be a big problem, miles from your car.
		(John Mills, a great skier in Bountiful Utah, told me a story once about how he had to
		pee on his binding to clear the ice so that it would work again.  He hesitated for quite
		a while before following the prompting to do so, and it saved him from possibly staying the night.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Anyhow, I'd like to believe I've learned my lesson.  Wet-slides are generally more managable
		than slab avalanches, but regardless of the type, you don't want to risk triggering one.
		I also learned to keep a keen eye on the changing weather as I tour.  The snowpack doesn't like
		change, and it especially doesn't like rapped change, whether that's due to temporature, additional
		loading, wind, or whatever else.  If you think the snowpack is table, it likely to stay that way
		if the weather is stable too.
		</p>
		<p>
		Terrain is the great equilizer.  All else being equal, if you're not in avalanche terrain, then
		you don't have to worry about avalanches.  The catch is that identifying avalanche terrain isn't
		entirely trivial.  A flat spot of ground is avalanche terrain if it's in an avalanche run-out zone.
		</p>
		<h2>The Ski Run</h2>
		<p>
		I know not many people will think the ski run is all that great, but I think it's awesome.
		It goes right down the south-west face of Session's Peak and slowly tapers before it reaches
		the bottom of the basin.  (Not sure it's technically a basin, but whatever.)  There's really not
		much I can say here.  You just have to go ski it for yourself.  I think it's a great line.
		</p>
		<h2>The Exit</h2>
		<p>
		Once you've gone down the main ski run off of Session's Peak, you're committed, because there's
		no way out without risking further exposure to avalanche terrain.  On days when I thought things were
		stable enougn, I just skinned right back out of the basin up to Kenny Peak.  On other days I've
		skied down to the horse trough where the Kenny Creek trail is, and then followed that back out
		to the Kenny Creek cabin.  That works too, but it's a terrain trap near the canyon bottom.
