		<p>
		I use the name Kenny Peak to refer to the high point on Session's Ridge just
		above Kenny Creek Cabin (a burnt down pile of rubble as it was burned down
		several years ago.)  The south-west fast of this peak has a lot of great ski
		terrain, but the (solar) aspect is not favorable, and winds typically hammer
		this area pretty badly.  Still, my best powder was in this area.  I love to go
		up to this peak, do several laps off it, then a final one that goes all the way
		down to a stream just below the cabin, skin back to the cabin, then ski back out
		the way I came.  The best approach is gas pipeline, which, under good conditions,
		allows you to ski all the way back down to the bottom of the canyon where you can
		ski all the way back to your car.
