		<h1>Cold Fusion Couloir</h1>
		<p>
		Believe it or not, I skied this stupid thing.  Owen said it had more bark than bite,
		but that's because he's a great skier.  I think it had both bark and plenty of bite.
		</p>
		<p>
		I had the place all to myself the day I did it.  It was a day late in the season when
		some people were done skiing, but the couloir was plenty filled in because we had had
		a mega super record-breaking snow year.
		</p>
		<p>
		I recall how pathetic my ascent was, not to mention my descent, which I'll get to in a moment.
		Going up the thing was a long booter, and it nearly killed me because of how horribly out
		of shape I am.  It was also a bit nerve racking, because it is quite steep.  Ice axe
		and crampons were a good choice the day.  I think I gave myself an over-use injury by the
		time I finally draggy my sorry butt to the top.
		</p>
		<p>
		As for the descent, all I can really say is that I did ski it.  I skied it very badly, but
		I did ski it, and I didn't side-slip it or take my skis off at any time.  I stopped about
		a zillion times to catch my breath because I was hyper-ventillating (more from being out
		of breath than scared...I think.)
		</p>
		<p>
		The steepness really wasn't a problem for me; it was the consequences.  If you blew a turn,
		and didn't self arrest, you'd accelerate down the slope, faster and faster, until you hit rocks
		or trees and died.
		</p>
		<p>
		In any case, I'm glad I did it, and it was neat.  I'm embarrassed to say that once I finally
		got to the bottom, I think I charley-horsed really badly.  I guess I should be glad that
		happened after I had gotten down.
		</p>
		<p>
		I think I lost all pictures of this, but if I find one, I'll put it up.
